# 📊 Data Analysis with NumPy & Pandas

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks showcasing practical skills in data analysis using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and real-world datasets from **Kaggle**.

---

## 🔹 1. `numpy.ipynb`
- Introduction to NumPy and its importance in data science.
- Matrix creation (1D, 2D) and manipulation.
- Mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, dot product).
- Indexing, slicing, reshaping, transposing.
- Statistical functions (mean, std, log, exp, etc.).

---

## 🔹 2. `Pandas .ipynb`
- Working with DataFrames and CSV files.
- Data inspection (`head`, `info`, `describe`).
- Handling missing values (`fillna`, `mean`, `mode`).
- Renaming, encoding, and transforming columns.
- Filtering, sorting, and merging datasets.

## 🔹 3. `practical .ipynb`
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on housing prices dataset from Kaggle.
- Data visualization using:
  - Pie charts
  - Bar plots
  - Boxplots
  - Histograms
- Statistical analysis and insights from real-world data.
